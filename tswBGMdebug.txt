# By default, BGM is on after running tswBGM. By uncommenting the following line, you make `off' default, and you can turn BGM on by pressing the hotkey later
# $BGM = false

# If the program fails to automatically find the handle of the window or processthread ID of TSW, uncomment the following lines and manually assign them here, and then restart tswBGM
# $hWnd = 0x0
# $pID = 0
# $tID = 0

# The following lines modifies the hotkey to be Alt+F2
MODIFIER = 1
KEY = 113
# Other examples
# MODIFIER = 6; KEY = 90 # Ctrl+Shift+Z
# MODIFIER = 0; KEY = 9 # Tab. This is dangerous and deprecated
# And so on.
